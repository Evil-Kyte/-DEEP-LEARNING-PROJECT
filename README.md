# -DEEP-LEARNING-PROJECT - CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
 
NAME : PAWAN MUDHAI

INTERN ID : CTO4DR693

DOMAIN : DATA SCIENCE

DURATION : 4 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

This project focuses on implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset.
The model was built and trained in TensorFlow/Keras, enabling accurate recognition of digits (0â€“9) from grayscale images.
The workflow includes data preprocessing, CNN model design, training and evaluation, and result visualization through accuracy/loss curves and sample predictions.
Key highlights:

Dataset: MNIST (60,000 training, 10,000 testing images)

Model: CNN with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers

Framework: TensorFlow / Keras

Achieved accuracy: ~99% on test data

Tools: Python, TensorFlow, Matplotlib

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of deep learning principles, image processing, and neural network optimization, forming a foundation for more complex computer vision tasks.
